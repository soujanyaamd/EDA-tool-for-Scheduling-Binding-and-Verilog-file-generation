# EDA-tool-for-Scheduling-Binding-and-Verilog-file-generation

Given an input file and a resource constaints file in a specified csv format, this project can generate a optimal scheduling amd binding solution, adhering to the timing and resource constaints.
Based on the generated solution and the inputs files, a simulatable Verilog file is also generated.
